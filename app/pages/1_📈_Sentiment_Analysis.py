        Itâ€™s useful to look at stock market levels compared to where theyâ€™ve been over the past few months.
        When the S&P 500 is above its moving or rolling average of the prior 125 trading days, 
        thatâ€™s a sign of positive momentum. But if the index is below this average, 
        it shows investors are getting skittish. The Fear & Greed Index uses slowing momentum as a signal for Fear

        The most well-known measure of market sentiment is the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX. 
        The VIX measures expected price fluctuations or volatility in the S&P 500 Index options over the next 30 days. 
        The VIX often drops on days when the broader market rallies and soars when stocks plunge. 
        But the key is to look at the VIX over time. 
        It tends to be lower in bull markets and higher when the bears are in control. 
        The Fear & Greed Index uses increasing market volatility as a signal for Fear.
